/*
 * NOTES
 *
 * 1) INTERFACE: a contract that defines a set of capabilities.  A class is said to IMPLEMENT an interface
 *    by (a) declaring that it implements the interface and (b) by defining methods whose signature, modifiers,
 *    and return types match those defined in the interface.
 *
 * 2) METHOD SIGNATURE: a combination of the method's name and its parameter types.
 *    e.g.: a method public int add(int a, int b) has the signature add(int, int)
 *
 * 3) MODIFIERS: keywords that provide additional information about a method or class
 *    e.g.: in a method like public static void main(String[] args), "public" and "static" are modifiers.
 *    "public" indicates this method can be called by any object.
 *    "static" indicates this method is not associated with a specific object, but with the class itself
 *       (we'll discuss this later)
 *
 * 4) MEMBER:
 *    A variable associated with an object.
